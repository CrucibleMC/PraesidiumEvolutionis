# PraesidiumEvolutionis (WIP)
A small library of utility APIs for enhancing plugin-mod interactions in hybrids servers while offering safe fallbacks
on forge-only servers (and the integrated server).


## This is a work in progress
Right now this is a complete mess of random stuff I use to back my plugin-mod integrations for my server.
Give me some time, and hopefully I can bring a half useful project out of it - juanmuscaria
